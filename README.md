I read the transformer paper in 2023, and I have now resumed and organized the code implementation that was suspended at that time.

I have completed the implementation of the main structures such as the encoder and decoder that compose the transformer, but the final process of combining them to ultimately design the Transformer is still in progress....

Check  " Transformer_pytorch.ipynb "
